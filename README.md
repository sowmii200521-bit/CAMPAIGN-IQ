## 🎯 The Challenge

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### ❌ **The Problem**

Health organizations struggle to evaluate campaign effectiveness accurately:

- **Correlation ≠ Causation**: Simple comparisons mislead
- **Confounding Variables**: District, age, conditions skew results
- **Biased Assessments**: Unable to isolate true campaign impact
- **Resource Waste**: No data-driven allocation strategy

</td>
<td width="50%">

### ✅ **The Solution**

Advanced causal inference pipeline that delivers:

- **AIPW Estimator**: Doubly-robust causal measurement
- **K-Fold Cross-Fitting**: Statistical rigor & bias prevention
- **ATE & CATE Analysis**: Overall and segment-specific impact
- **Actionable Insights**: Data-driven resource optimization

### IBM Z Community Cloud Use Case

The IBM Z Community Cloud provided the core infrastructure for deploying CampaignIQ, serving as a secure, reliable, and enterprise-grade platform for our full-stack data science application.

| Component/Feature | Role in CampaignIQ Project | Benefit & Advantage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LinuxONE VM (s390x)** | Core infrastructure for hosting the entire application stack (Nginx, Flask, React). | Provided an **enterprise-grade, secure, and reliable platform**, ideal for handling sensitive data analysis and running AI workloads. |
| **Ubuntu 22.04 OS** | The operating system for installing all software (Python, Node.js, Nginx). | Offered a **familiar and standard Linux environment**, making development and deployment straightforward on the Z architecture. |
| **Public Networking** | Made the web application globally accessible via a public IP and secured the server using the `ufw` firewall. | Demonstrated **standard cloud networking capabilities**, allowing the project to be deployed and used like any modern web application. |
| **Production Stack** | Hosted a complete production-ready stack: **Nginx** as a reverse proxy, **Flask** for the backend API, and **PM2** as a process manager. | Showcased that the platform can run a **modern, robust software stack**, proving its versatility for data-driven web solutions. |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### **Prerequisites**

```bash
# Required software
✓ Node.js & npm
✓ Python 3.x & pip
```

### **⚙️ Configuration: Hugging Face Token** 🔑

The project requires a Hugging Face token for ML model access. Choose your preferred method:

<details>
<summary><b>📌 Method 1: Environment File (Recommended)</b></summary>

**Most secure - prevents token exposure in version control**

1. Create `.env` in the project root (`v1/.env`):
   ```bash
   HF_TOKEN="your_hugging_face_token_here"
   ```

2. Verify `.env` is in `.gitignore`

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>⚡ Method 2: Direct Code Entry (Quick Setup)</b></summary>

**Faster setup for development**

1. Open `v1/backend/causal_impact.py`
2. Navigate to line ~74 and update:
   ```python
   hf_token = os.environ.get("HF_TOKEN", "your_actual_token_here")
   ```

</details>
